first learn the syntax.
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-name"> </span>
Now consider this example which skips the intermediate steps and directly jumps to the high level. ;-)

<p>Print icon on a styled link button:
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-success btn-lg">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-print"></span> Print 
    </a>
</p> 
Clearly it shows the "success button", which is "large" and also "gyphicon print" is used as a "link" inside the button with the text inside it "Print"
Awesome. :D
