You can add thumbnail class to a tag also, in that way hyper links can be provided along with extra information inside that thumbnail.



If you want to show some code in between, like usually found in w3schools, bootstrap official website etc., you can add the tag <code> Some code in between</code>



You can add scroll bar to a pre tag by using class .pre-scrollable, it's really awesome



Page header, a small thin line on the bottom of the top heading is already a built in function in the class .page-header



Alerts, success, info, warning, error. Really awesome. But alerts without closing button at the right corner are not that much good and sometimes irritating, so add the close prop using it in the following manner

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
    <strong>Warning!</strong> This alert box could indicate a warning that might need attention.
</div>
If you want to fade in the alert message while closing, then use the class .fade .in along with the above part as.
class="alert alert-warning fade in"
