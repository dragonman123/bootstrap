.btn-default, normal white button
.btn-primary, button with decent blue background
.btn-success, button with green background indicating success
.btn-info, button with light blue background
.btn-warning, warning, yellow button
.btn-danger, red background obviously. ;-)
.btn-lin, just a link in the form of a button, no backgroud color for that.


Now that the main classification based on the background color, you can also decide which type of button to put, like the small or the large, or medium.

.btn-lg
.btn-md
.btn-sm
.btn-xs
Where xs stands for xtra small

Next classification is active or disabled button.
So just add active or disabled along with the button class that you are using.


Next to enable block level button, just use this .btn-block class.ss

Now coming to buttons group which I reallly found awesome.
Just use the .btn-grp class to and add buttons that you want, they will come in one line and will give super feel..:-)
Obviously the buttons can be put both in the vertical and the horizontal lines. :-), for vertical alignment of the buttons, use btn-group-vertical
The size classification is also there in the buttons, like btn-grp-lg, or btn-grp-xs.

Other, 
btn-group-justified, just explore this.


NOW ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE.
The button with the dropdown menu.

<div class="btn-group">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown">
      Sony <span class="caret"></span></button>
      <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu">
        <li><a href="#">Tablet</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Smartphone</a></li>
      </ul>
</div>
here caret is the sign that is used to indicate the dropdown list.

Now using just the above concept that we have learnt, we can easily design a button with seperate or splitted dropdown (hint, just use two seperate separate buttons)
